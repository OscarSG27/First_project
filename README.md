This is my first project, based in native PHP, JS (with AJAX), SQL and HTML. ItÂ´s a library management. It allows new books registration in database, delete books, modifications and read data. There are two access,
one of them for users and the other one for administrators. There are validations in HTML and JS.

I hope you like it.
